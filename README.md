However the FAQ and general guidelines will be outlined here.
This module contains automated tools and effects, feats and other things used in the Homebrew
Other Homebrew content have been included but have no automated functions.

Currently, individual Pocket creatures are Ancestries and whether you're Mono-Type or Dual-Type is your heritage.
The types themselves are Ancestry Features, you may drag and drop them into your character sheet if your Player-character lacks them and delete the ones you do not want.

If you are playing with the optional rulesets to add Type Matchups or Unarmed attacks, they can be found under the GM Tools folder of this module and dragged onto players and NPCs.
Included in this module is also a damage type Override tool to alter the damage of any Strikes to whatever you want, it is also in the GM tools folder. 
This override only functions for specific damage types and can have unexpected side-effects, use at your own discretion.
